                <p>Greetings! I am Jari, a dedicated game developer hailing from Oulu. My technical prowess encompasses a wide array of tools and languages, making me a versatile asset for game development projects.<p>
                <h4 class="w3-padding-16">Technical Skills</h4>
                <p>Proficient in: Unity, Visual Studio, Blender, MySQL, VS-Code, GitHub and Microsoft Office. </p>
                <p>Skilled in programming languages: C#, C, and GdScript</p>
                <p>Competent with game engines including:  Unity, Godot, and GameMaker 2</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>I recently completed my education as a software developer with a specialization in game development in June 2023. Throughout my academic journey, I wholeheartedly embraced Unity, dedicating both my study and leisure time to mastering its intricacies.
                <p>I possess an unwavering commitment to the field of game development and am keen to contribute my skills to meaningful projects. While I am at the initial stages of my career, my enthusiasm knows no bounds, and I harbor a profound aspiration to collaborate with fellow game developers within a professional setting. My strengths lie in problem-solving and fostering effective teamwork. As a programmer, I thrive under high pressure situations, remaining composed and unflustered. I am eager to embark on this exciting journey and would greatly appreciate any constructive feedback.</p>

      <h5>I'm excited to introduce my latest project</h5>
      <p>an asteroid game that I've been diligently crafting. You're invited to experience the thrills and challenges it offers by downloading it from my GitHub page. Dive into a world of space exploration and strategy as you dodge and destroy asteroids. Your feedback is invaluable in refining this game, and I can't wait for you to give it a try!.</p> <a href="https://github.com/Keimo92/Space-Ship-Shooter">Full game here!</a>

      <h4>8bit bird.</h4>
      <p>I recently developed a simple Flappy Bird-inspired game in a single night as a creative endeavor during my leisure time. This project was born out of a desire to challenge myself and explore game development further. The game now includes mobile input functionality, enhancing its accessibility and user experience. I intend to share this project on GitHub, where it will be available for review and potential collaboration.</p>

      <img src="Images/passthrough2.gif" alt="passthrough" style="width:100%">
      <h4>FabLab Internship</h4>
      <p>This project was a client-focused endeavor where I successfully integrated virtual reality (VR) and the physical world to create a cohesive and immersive experience. The development process included a fascinating feature: the incorporation of my gaming room, which is visible through the window, with a prominent Super Mario display. I implemented a unique functionality using the Quest PRO controller's A-Button, allowing users to seamlessly toggle between passthrough and VR modes. This innovation results in a noticeable and engaging flicker effect, providing users with a clear perspective of the stark difference between the two environments.</p>

      <h4>FabLab Internship</h4>
      <p>Fab Lab project, I've taken innovation to the next level by seamlessly integrating my living room couch into a diverse array of surrounding objects in VR. Explore this intriguing fusion of technology, demonstrating the endless possibilities of creative ingenuity with passthrough Oculus headset.</p>

      <h4>OSAO Game developer cource</h4>
      <p>During my enrollment in the OSAO Game Developer Course, I had the opportunity to contribute significantly to the creation of an engaging rat-themed game. The core challenge of the game revolves around ascending before being overtaken by rising water levels, showcasing my expertise in programming. This experience not only honed my technical skills but also exemplified my commitment to the world of game development.</p>

      <h4>MeKiwi Internship</h4>
      <p>During my MeKiwi internship, I played a pivotal role in developing a dynamic shooting mechanism integrated with hitboxes, powered by advanced raycasting techniques. This innovative approach allowed precise tracking of where the game object was aimed, triggering captivating particle effects to simulate the impact of each shot. My involvement in this project underscores my proficiency in game mechanics and my ability to deliver immersive gameplay experiences.</p>

      <h4>MeKiwi Internship</h4>
      <p>I undertook the intriguing challenge of creating a lightsaber within the game, complete with realistic sound effects triggered by movement. To achieve this, I strategically implemented an audio source within the saber itself, employing vector-based logic to initiate sound playback when the controller's motion exceeded a specific threshold. This innovative solution not only showcases my technical acumen but also demonstrates my dedication to delivering immersive and authentic gaming experiences.</p>
